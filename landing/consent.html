<h1>SMS Consent & Messaging Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

<h2>What is PawPing?</h2>
<p>PawPing is an SMS-based assistant for veterinary clinics. When a client calls a clinic and the call is missed, PawPing sends a follow-up text message offering to help with appointment booking, medication refills, and general inquiries.</p>

<h2>How Consent is Obtained</h2>
<p>Customers opt in to receive SMS messages by initiating a phone call to a PawPing-enabled veterinary clinic. When that call is missed (no answer or busy), the caller receives a single automated text message offering assistance. Any further conversation is initiated entirely by the customer choosing to reply.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Opt-in method:</strong> Verbal/implied — the customer initiates contact by calling the clinic.</li>
  <li><strong>First message:</strong> A single SMS is sent in direct response to their missed call.</li>
  <li><strong>Continued conversation:</strong> Only occurs if the customer replies to the initial message.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Message Frequency</h2>
<p>Customers receive one automated SMS per missed call. Additional messages are only sent in response to customer-initiated replies. Message frequency varies based on the conversation.</p>

<h2>Opting Out</h2>
<p>Customers can opt out at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong> to any message. Once opted out, no further messages will be sent. Customers can opt back in by replying <strong>START</strong>.</p>

<h2>Message & Data Rates</h2>
<p>Standard message and data rates may apply depending on the customer's mobile carrier and plan.</p>
